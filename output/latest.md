  - *Md Ariful Haque, Sander Vinberg, Ben Edwards et al.*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Anticipating Q-day security concerns, major CDNs and cloud providers are migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While existing literature benchmarks PQC performance, empirical research evaluating real-world adoption data remains scarce. We present an empirical assessment o…

  - *Md Ariful Haque, Sander Vinberg, Ben Edwards et al.*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - With the anticipated arrival of Q-day, quantum computers threaten current cryptographic schemes for encryption and digital signatures. In response, major content delivery networks and cloud service providers are already adopting Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The current state-…

- **[TailDART: Compute-Efficient Foundation Models for Financial Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09176v1)**
  - *Chiang Qin Zhi, Ranjan Satapathy, Erik Cambria et al.*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Although time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong zero-shot transferability across high-information-density physical systems, applying overparameterized TSFMs to quantitative finance is fundamentally constrained by low signal-to-noise ratios, non-stationarity, and pro…

- **[Same Facts, Different Remedy: Linguistic Profiling and Arbitrariness in LLM and System One Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.08995v1)**
  - *Colin Priest*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Large language models are increasingly used to resolve consumer complaints, and the way complainants write varies with age, education and socioeconomic status (SES). We audit three remedy-decision systems using sociolinguistic rewrites of US consumer financial complaints that are…

- **[Frame: Form-Restricted Authoring with Model-Based Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.08921v1)**
  - *Nan Jiang, Mohammed Mohsin Hussain, Onkar Tiwari et al.*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Many professional reports reuse the structure of prior editions while updating the content. We formalize this setting as form-restricted report generation: given a sample report and new grounding documents, generate a report that preserves the sample's form while accurately refle…

- **[Towards Robust Reinforcement Learning Market Making: Lessons from Loss Function Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09012v1)**
  - *Siddharth Nand, Bora Guney*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Market makers play a vital role in ensuring efficient trade within financial markets. Recent literature has delved into training market-making systems using reinforcement learning. This paper delves into the impact of various loss function formulations on risk management behavior…

- **[Joint modelling of financial cost and carbon footprint in motor insurance claims: a BINAR(1) decision framework for circular auto parts adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09213v1)**
  - *Charles Minier, Stéphane Loisel, Renata Alcoforado*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Motor insurance claims management increasingly faces a dual objective: controlling claim costs while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions associated with vehicle repair decisions. This paper proposes a bivariate, discrete-time modelling framework that links the dynamics of financial…

- **[Scout Before You Route: Predicting Task Success and Token Count from a Small LLM Prefill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09028v1)**
  - *Aristides Milios, Christopher Pal*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Routers typically choose a model per query by trading predicted correctness against cost. Most price each model at a fixed cost, as if every query used the same number of output tokens, but the output length of reasoning models varies by an order of magnitude across queries. When…

- **[Know What You Need: Efficient Activation Checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09614v1)**
  - *Danyal Ahmed, Edouard Oyallon*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Large Language Model training is increasingly constrained by memory capacity. Activation Checkpointing reduces activation memory by avoiding storing selected activations during the forward pass and rematerializing them during backpropagation, thereby trading memory savings for ad…

- **[Beyond the Grid: Continuous Dictionary Pursuit for Interpretable Signal Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09163v1)**
  - *Nick Janssen, Melanie Schaller, Bodo Rosenhahn*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Deep learning models achieve high accuracy in signal processing but remain difficult to interpret. Classical matching pursuit and sparse coding offer better transparency but suffer from spectral leakage and grid mismatch when signal frequencies do not align with discrete dictiona…

- **[Calibrating your confidence requires thinking of all the ways you could be wrong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.08997v1)**
  - *Marco Miani*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - A primary limitation of modern deep learning is the miscalibration of model confidence; traditional architectures fundamentally lack a mechanism to quantify their own uncertainty. Larger models and larger datasets mitigate this issue, but they do not resolve the underlying struct…

- **[The End-of-Day Reversal After 2019: A Pre-Registered Test on S&P 500 Stocks Excluding Heavily Traded Names](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09286v1)**
  - *Alex Vidovich, Zivana Zerjal*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Baltussen, Da and Soebhag (2025) document an end-of-day reversal in U.S. stocks through December 2019: intraday losers outperform intraday winners over the last half hour of trading. We test it on later data, on point-in-time S&P 500 members excluding about 80 heavily traded stoc…

- **[The Logic of Factor Portfolios: Boolean Rules, Interactions, and Trading Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.09834v1)**
  - *Ziyao Wang, Svetlozar T. Rachev, Frank J. Fabozzi*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - Investors turn signals into holdings through decision rules: buy the top decile, hold stocks with high momentum and low volatility, exclude stocks that fail a screen. Many such rules are Boolean functions of threshold statements about signal ranks, and writing them this way shows…

- **[Portfolio-aware scenario transfer of reserve movements: evidence from Lloyd's syndicates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.08968v1)**
  - *Colin Priest*
  - `2026-11-06`
  - A claims-development movement on one portfolio may not transfer directly as a stress to another size. We estimate how to transfer such scenarios between portfolio sizes, using 632 syndicate-years from 117 Lloyd's syndicates over 2015-2024. The measured movement is the change in g…
